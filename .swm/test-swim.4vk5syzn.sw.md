# Introduction

This document will walk you through the recent code changes related to the "test: swim" feature. The purpose of this feature is to enhance the testing capabilities within the application.

We will cover:

1. Why a new API endpoint constant was added.
2. The purpose of the `addNumbers` function in the view model.

# API endpoint constant

<SwmSnippet path="lib/constants/api_endpoints.dart" line="9">

---

The addition of a new API endpoint constant in <SwmPath>[lib/constants/api_endpoints.dart](/lib/constants/api_endpoints.dart)</SwmPath> is crucial for the swim testing feature. This constant, labeled as `testing`, serves as a dedicated endpoint for testing purposes, ensuring that test requests are directed appropriately without interfering with production endpoints.

```

  ///For swim testing
  final String testing = 'testing';
```

# AddNumbers function in auth view model

<SwmSnippet path="lib/viewModel/auth_view_model.dart" line="58">

---

The `addNumbers` function in <SwmPath>[lib/viewModel/auth_view_model.dart](/lib/viewModel/auth_view_model.dart)</SwmPath> is a utility function that sums two integers. While it may seem trivial, its inclusion is likely for testing arithmetic operations or as a placeholder for more complex logic in the future. It demonstrates the ability to perform basic operations within the view model context.

```

  int addNumbers(int a, int b){
    return a+b;
  }
```
